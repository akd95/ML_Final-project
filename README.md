Details of project: Our objective is to build a classification model, learned using historical data provided by amazon and available from Kaggle competitions, that will determine whether an employee should be given access or not. Since it is a classification problem we will first try to use Linear classifiers (SVM, Logistic Regression) and measure the performance using Accuracy or ROC-AUC. If the performance is not up to the mark then we will try to use RandomForest classifier. We will use the best model we can come up with and use it to predict what is required and measure its performance using ROC-AUC.

Data: The data consists of real historical data collected by Amazon from 2010 & 2011 and is available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/amazon-employee-access-challenge/data
